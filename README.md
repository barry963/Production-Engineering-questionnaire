Changelog

1.0
Sense and response form
  Add new function
    1. Send the result file to corresponding email address
    2. Every attribute name is customixed text, which allows the client to edit when using and it will remain unless       refreshing the page
  Improvement
    Add generated form and file the customixed text
Future Improvement
1. Import excel file
2. not jump to php page after sending email(ajax passes both variable and file)
3. directly send the generated file, instead of choosing.


Try to resolve the problem that users must choose the generated file. The key point is to find a way to pass a generated file or file variable to the php. But until now I havenot solved that. So the alternative choice might be that directly pass the raw data to php and then generated an excel file.
